# AngularCdk

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.0.3.

## @angular/cdk - it’s a headless UI toolkit

@angular/cdk (Component Dev Kit) is a package from Angular that provides essential building blocks for creating sophisticated UI components. It offers reusable utilities and behaviors without enforcing specific styles, unlike Angular Material.

Key Features of @angular/cdk:

Accessibility (@angular/cdk/a11y) – Utilities to make components accessible (e.g., focus management, screen reader support).

Drag and Drop (@angular/cdk/drag-drop) – Adds draggable and droppable functionality.

Overlay (@angular/cdk/overlay) – Handles floating elements like modals, tooltips, and dropdowns.

Portal (@angular/cdk/portal) – Enables dynamically loading components in different locations.

Scrolling (@angular/cdk/scrolling) – Provides virtual scrolling for better performance with large lists.

Table (@angular/cdk/table) – Low-level utilities to build custom tables.

Tree (@angular/cdk/tree) – Utilities to build tree structures like file explorers.

Text Field (@angular/cdk/text-field) – Enhances text inputs (e.g., auto-resizing textarea).

Stepper (@angular/cdk/stepper) – Utilities for building step-based workflows.

Clipboard (@angular/cdk/clipboard) – Provides copy-to-clipboard functionality.

Since it’s a headless UI toolkit, you can use it independently or along with Angular Material to create custom components. 

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
